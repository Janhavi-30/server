This script implements a prime number generator and exposes it through both a command-line interface and a REST API.
This code now provides four prime number generation strategies: naive, sieve, trial division, and segmented sieve


Features:
- Prime number generation with two strategies: naive and sieve.
-Implemented additional strategies beyond the naive and sieve methods
with two more strategies: the Trial Division and the Sieve of Eratosthenes with Segmented Sieve.
- Command-line interface for generating primes with specified start, end, and strategy.
- REST API endpoints for generating primes within a range and retrieving execution history.
- Execution logging to an in-memory SQLite database.

Sections:
1. Imports: Import necessary libraries for the script.
2. Prime number generator functions: Contains functions for generating prime numbers using two different strategies.
3. Database setup: Creates an in-memory SQLite database for logging executions.
4. API endpoints: Defines routes for the REST API, including prime number generation and execution history retrieval.
5. Unit tests: Contains unit tests for the prime number generator functions.
6. Main block: Handles script execution based on command-line arguments, running the server or generating primes based on input.

Usage:
- To run the script as a server: python script.py server
- To generate primes from the command line: python script.py <start> <end> <strategy>
- Available strategies: naive, sieve

To apply SOLID principles to your code, let's break down each principle and see how we can incorporate them:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or module should have only one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Let's see how we can apply these principles:

SRP: Your Flask application and prime number generation logic are mixed together. We can separate them into different modules or classes.

OCP: By using a strategy pattern, we can allow adding new prime number generation strategies without modifying existing code.

LSP: Ensure that any strategy implementing the prime number generation interface can be used interchangeably.

ISP: Ensure that the interface for prime number generation is not bloated with unnecessary methods.

DIP: Use dependency injection to decouple the Flask application from the prime number generation strategies.
